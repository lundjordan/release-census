# Welcome to releaseduty Day1 checklist and FAQ section!

## Intro
If you're reading this page it means that you're ramping up as an official releaseduty squirrel within Mozilla Releng, so please allow us to give you a warm welcome!

Releaseduty is a designated pass-the-token role that we assign every 6 weeks to members of the team. Role mainly entails handling all the coordination and communication with other teams (such as QE, RelMan, etc) as well as doing all the
mechanics to make sure the release workflow is as smooth as possible. While this role can get quite disruptive at times, we prefer this approach of delegating this responsability to a small set of people that can own this, while we shield the others from interruptions so that they can better focus
on improving our automation and work on other RelEng infra-related projects.

Being releaseduty means a couple of things:
- handle communication/coordination with other teams
- handle all incoming releases
- fix and debug any potential errors that might have slipped in the automation
- develop and continuously improve the Release Automation process
