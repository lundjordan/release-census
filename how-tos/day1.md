Welcome to releaseduty!

If you're reading this page it means that you're ramping up as an official releaseduty squirrel within Mozilla Releng, so please allow us to give you a warm welcome!
Releaseduty is a designated pass-the-token role that we assign here at MozRelEng every 6 weeks to members of the team. Role mainly entails handling all the coordination and communication with other teams (such as QE, RelMan, etc) as well as doing all the
mechanics to make sure the release workflow is as smooth as possible. While this role can get quite disruptive at times, we prefer this approach of delegating this responsability to a small set of people that can own this, while we shield the other RelEngers from interruptions so that they can focus
on improving our automation and work on other RelEng infra-related projects.
